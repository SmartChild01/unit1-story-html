      She started by collecting wood and then putting them together to form a tent and with strands of grass she tied them up together.
      After she got more wood and rocks to make a fire. 
      At night she heared a noise, she got scared but she faces her fears and got a stick and went outside. In the bushed she sa movement,
      when she went closer and the creature jumped out! The creature said:"This island is not safe! Go away when you still can!" She wispered
      loudly. Eva was confised and said back:"Wait, don't go away!" The creature stoped and said:"The <b>hydra</b> is wating for me." Eva didn't 
      care so she followd her without the creatue knowing. 

      They kept walking and walking untill they stopped.
